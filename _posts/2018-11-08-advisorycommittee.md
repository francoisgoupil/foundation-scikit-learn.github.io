Two engineers have already been recruited and the COO should be selected in the coming days.

### Feedback on the Technical Committee meeting
Gaël introduced the reactions from the community to our [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5Ijebe123sSaRKIfdBzh5YwJvcQimX0z8SB-vWm518/edit?usp=sharing)

### Communication and promotion activities

The event of September 17th was quite successful, in terms of both attendance and media impact

This event and other information relating to the scikit-learn consortium are displayed on the [Web site](https://scikit-learn.fondation-inria.fr/)

In 2019, two main types of meetings will be organized:

- Monthly sprints with partners, for addressing technical and implementation issues
- A yearly event for training and networking with the whole scikit-learn community

Both types of event could be alternately hosted by partners (AXA and BNP Paribas Cardif already offered making their auditorium available)

The yearly event should take place before summer

### Opportunity to accept new members in the consortium

Two applications have been received after the 17 September event

- One from Criteo (Elvis Dohmatob)
- One from H&M (Arti Zeighami)

Both companies have been informed of the conditions for joining the consortium
All the participants have declared that they support these applications.
